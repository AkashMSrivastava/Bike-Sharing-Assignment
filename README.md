## General Information
### A US bike-sharing provider aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people. They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
### The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

### This project includes
- Reading and Understanding the Data
- Cleaning and Preparing the Data
- Visualising Data through graphs
- Splitting the data for training and testing
- Scaling the Features
- Feature Selection (Manual & with RFE)
- Building Models
- Residual Analysis of the training data
- Making Predictions Using the Final Model
- Model Evaluation
- Conclusion on the features most contributing towards explining the target


### Conclusions
<b>Following are the top 3 features contributing significantly:</b>
<ul>1. <b>temp</b> (Higher <b>Temperature</b> Increases the demand)</ul>
<ul>2. <b>weathersit</b> (When weather has <b>LightSnow</b> it Decreases the demand)</ul>
<ul>3. <b>yr</b> (Higher <b>Year</b> Increases the target, i.e. Year 2019 indicate higher demand, as compared to 2018)</ul>
